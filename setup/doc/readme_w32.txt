Description: The Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) installs runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications developed with Visual C++ SP1 on a computer that does not have Visual C++ 2008 SP1 installed.

How to install the runtime components: Use the "Download" button in the page referred above. This will download "vcredist_x86.exe". You must run vcredist_x86.exe to ensure the required system runtime libraries are installed on your computer. You only need to run vcredist_x86.exe once.
