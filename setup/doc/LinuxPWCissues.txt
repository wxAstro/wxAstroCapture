Please note that there are some issues with the Philips Webcam Driver (PWC) on actual Linux distributions.
This is related to the PWC driver version 10.0.12.

Below whenever $> is shown it means that this is the prompt of a unix shell (command line)
so $> dmesg      means to open a unix shell and type  dmesg after the prompt then hiting the enter key


How to tell the PWC version? 
$> dmesg | grep pwc

... pwc: Philips webcam module version 10.0.12 is loaded
... more lines

Known issues:

a) The Saturation slider does not work 
   - the PWC driver has a flaw setting the saturation

b) The Philips SPC900 camera is treated as PCVC720 type instead of PCVC740 (ToUCam Pro)
   - the PWC driver assigned a wrong tag, the camera may behave not as expected 
     we only know about LED issues which is not used by wxAstroCapture
	 
We expect that this will be addressed with an update of the PWC driver module in the future.

If you need to get saturation work you may update the driver module yourselves.
But please start it only if you have read the full text below and are sure what you have to do.


I guess one has to have some kernel build items installed - 
I don't know if they are loaded with the standard distribution but it would complain when doing the make later.

How to do it - 

Grab the latest driver snapshot from here (http://www.saillard.org/linux/pwc/snapshots/)
 I got the one of the 4th July: pwc-v4l2-20070704-042701.tar.bz2
 This one has the SPC900 type issue already solved

OR

Get our temporary source package  pwc-v4l2-20070704-042701A.tar.gz

Extract to 'here' - i.e. right click and choose Extract - here
you will find a folder with the same name but the extension - dive into this folder

If you got ours you don't have to edit anything - just proceed to Make:

Open pwc-ctrl.c  with a text editor e.g. with Kedit or so.

Now find the following part  (~ line 626):

/* @param value saturation color between [-100 , 100] */ 
int pwc_set_saturation(struct pwc_device *pdev, int value) {
	char buf;
	int saturation_register;

	if (pdev->type < 675)
		return -EINVAL;
	if (value < -100)
		value = -100;
	if (value > 100)
		value = 100;
	if (pdev->type < 730)
		saturation_register = SATURATION_MODE_FORMATTER2;
	else
		saturation_register = SATURATION_MODE_FORMATTER1;
	return SendControlMsg(SET_CHROM_CTL, saturation_register, 1); 
}

Add the line:  buf = (char)value;
Before the return SendControlMsg(..) line

this looks like the follwing:
.
..
	if (pdev->type < 730)
		saturation_register = SATURATION_MODE_FORMATTER2;
	else
		saturation_register = SATURATION_MODE_FORMATTER1;
    buf = (char)value;
	return SendControlMsg(SET_CHROM_CTL, saturation_register, 1); 
}


Now save and leave the file


Make: 

Get a Unix shell and type

$> sudo make
$> sudo make install     this takes a while
$> sudo rmmod pwc        removes the driver
$> sudo modprobe pwc     installs the new one

Verify:

$> dmesg       should show that pwc was removed and a new one was installed

The snapshot does version 10.0.13
Our package does version  10.0.13a

Done
